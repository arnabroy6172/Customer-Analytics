Performed customer segmentation, by clustering techniques for dividing customers into groups. Applied the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, as well as combining PCA and K-means for an even more professional customer segmentation. Applied both the descriptive and predictive analysis(logistic Regression) of the purchase behaviour of customers.
